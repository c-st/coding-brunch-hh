## Past brunches

### React + Redux (27.10.2018)

```
Are you a developer and do you enjoy coding in your spare time? Do you have at least a basic level of JavaScript and have you been wanting to try out React? If you'd like to to have a go whilst enjoying a delicious breakfast at the same time, please come along to our hands-on React session!

Together we'll develop a single page application (including integration with a backend API) based on React and Redux. We'll start with a skeleton application and build some new features step by step. We'll also show you how to test the code.

Agenda

- 10am: Welcome and introduction
- React basics (mixture of theory and practical exercises)
- Redux basics
- Walk-through of our application
- Implementation of new features (in teams or mob)
- 3pm approx: Close
```
